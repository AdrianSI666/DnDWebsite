Instruction to create a postgres image and use it in this project via cmd/cli:
(You can skip this if you want just an empty database)

1) To create a dump file in postgres use this command:
    pg_dump -U username -F c database_name > backup.dump
   (If pg_dump is not recognized as internal command you need to add bin file of postgres to path env variable)

2) Either create a new docker image via provided Dockerfile with command ```docker build``` or copy by hand
a dump file into docker image via this command:
    docker cp backup.dump my_postgres_container:/backup.dump

3) To restore postgres backup you need to open bash in running container via this command:
    docker exec -it my_postgres_container bash
   Then after you're in bash terminal you can restore the database by this command:
    pg_restore -U username -d database_name /backup.dump
   (If you put any data to specified database before using this command, any records in non-empty table won't be
   recovered, so it's advisable to restore it to empty database)
